## What is it all about?

This is a master's degree project made in collaboration with the Department for visual computing at the Faculty of electrical and computer
engineering and information technologies in Osijek, Croatia.

## How was it done?

The idea behind the project was to implement a 3D game using Dart programming language and WebGL rendering API. At the time the project was started (spring
of 2015), the Dart language was a newborn and therefor the sole purpose was to prove that something visual in 3D space can be achieved
through its' usage.

## Tech details:
* [ThreeJS](threejs.org) wrapper library around WebGL was used for all things 3D
* 3D models are made in [Blender](www.blender.org) and exported as OBJ
* 2D texture maps are made in [GIMP](www.gimp.com) and exported as JPEG images
* Logic is implemented in Dart language using, now deprecated, Dart Editor with Dart SDK
* Front end side is standard HTML markup and CSS styling
