## What is it all about?

This is a master's degree project made in collaboration with the Department for visual computing at the Faculty of electrical and computer
engineering and information technologies in Osijek, Croatia.

## Why was it done?

The idea behind the project was to implement a 3D game using Dart programming language and WebGL rendering API. At the time the project was started (spring
of 2015), the Dart language was a newborn and therefor the sole purpose was to prove that something visual in 3D space can be achieved
through its' usage.

## Tech details:
* [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org) wrapper library around [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) was used for all things 3D
* 3D models are made in [Blender](https://www.blender.org) and exported as OBJ files
* 2D texture maps are made in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) and exported as JPEG images
* Logic is implemented in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) language using, now deprecated, Dart Editor with [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk)
* Front end side is standard [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) markup and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) styling
